# QSSH PQC Version Release Checklist

## Version: 0.2.0 - Post-Quantum Cryptography Release
**Release Date:** September 2025

## ✅ Core Features Implemented

### 🔐 Post-Quantum Cryptography
- [x] **Falcon-512** - Digital signatures
- [x] **SPHINCS+** - Hash-based signatures (alternative)
- [x] **Kyber** - Key encapsulation mechanism
- [x] Quantum-safe key exchange
- [x] Quantum-safe authentication

### 🖥️ Shell Functionality
- [x] Interactive shell with PTY allocation
- [x] Command execution
- [x] Terminal raw mode support
- [x] Proper I/O handling (fixed transport deadlock)
- [x] Clean output without debug messages

### 🔧 Core Components
- [x] Server (`qsshd`)
- [x] Client (`qssh`)
- [x] Key generation (`qssh-keygen`)
- [x] File transfer (`qscp`)
- [x] Configuration management

## 📋 Pre-Release Testing

### Basic Connectivity
```bash
# Start server on droplet
QSSH_AUTH_PATH=/tmp/qssh_auth ./target/release/qsshd --listen 0.0.0.0:4242

# Connect from client
./target/release/qssh -p 4242 root@167.99.188.242
```

### Feature Tests
- [ ] Key generation with different algorithms
  ```bash
  qssh-keygen -t falcon512
  qssh-keygen -t sphincs
  ```
- [ ] Interactive shell session
- [ ] Command execution with `-c` flag
- [ ] File transfer with `qscp`
- [ ] Port forwarding (`-L` and `-R` flags)
- [ ] Multiple concurrent connections
- [ ] Connection stability over time

### Security Tests
- [ ] Authentication with quantum-safe keys
- [ ] Rejection of invalid keys
- [ ] Encrypted transport verification
- [ ] Session key rotation

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Connection establishment time
- [ ] Data transfer throughput
- [ ] Shell responsiveness
- [ ] CPU usage under load

## 🐛 Known Issues Fixed
1. ✅ **Transport deadlock** - Fixed by splitting TcpStream into read/write halves
2. ✅ **Early EOF on keystroke** - Resolved with transport architecture fix
3. ✅ **Authentication path issues** - Fixed to check both .qssh and .ssh directories
4. ✅ **Shell prompt duplication** - Removed unnecessary initial newlines
5. ✅ **Debug output clutter** - Removed all debug eprintln statements

## 📝 Documentation

## Release Command
```bash
# Tag and release
git tag -a v0.2.0-pqc -m "Post-Quantum Cryptography Release"
git push origin v0.2.0-pqc

# Build release binaries
cargo build --release
```

## Verification Steps
1. Clean install on fresh system
2. Generate new keys
3. Configure server
4. Test client connection
5. Verify all cryptographic operations use PQC algorithms
6. Stress test with multiple connections
7. Security audit of implementation
