# QSSH Code Quality & Security Metrics

## Code Integrity

### Static Analysis Results
- **Memory Safety**: Written in Rust with minimal unsafe blocks
- **Error Handling**: Proper Result<T, E> types throughout
- **No Panics in Production**: Critical paths handle all error cases

### Cryptographic Implementation
- **Library Usage**: Uses established `pqcrypto` crates (not custom crypto)
- **NIST Algorithms**: Falcon-512 and SPHINCS+ from NIST PQC competition
- **Constant Time**: Cryptographic operations use constant-time implementations

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for protocol flows
- Tested on multiple platforms (Linux, macOS)

### Security Practices
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All keys generated at runtime
- **Secure Random**: Uses OS-provided cryptographic RNG
- **Key Zeroization**: Sensitive data cleared from memory after use

### Build Reproducibility
```bash
# Builds are reproducible with locked dependencies
cargo build --release --locked
```

### Continuous Integration
- All commits tested via GitHub Actions
- Multiple compiler versions tested
- Cross-platform compatibility verified

## Known Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
- QKD integration pending (framework complete, awaiting hardware)
- Some SSH features not yet implemented (agent forwarding, etc.)

### Code Metrics
- **Lines of Code**: ~15,000
- **Dependencies**: Minimal, all from crates.io
- **Unsafe Usage**: Limited to FFI boundaries only
